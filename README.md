# Iris Dataset Classification

This project demonstrates various machine learning models to classify the Iris dataset. The models used include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is used in this project. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: `SepalLengthCm`, `SepalWidthCm`, `PetalLengthCm`, and `PetalWidthCm`. The target variable is the species of the iris flower.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, visualize the data, and train the models.

## Models

The following models are trained and evaluated in the notebook:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

## Results

The accuracy of each model is printed after training and testing. The models are trained on both petal and sepal features separately.
